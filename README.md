# iu
store MyBB templates in files to make themes on steroids. currently in use on https://lewd.sx. this is old and could be better, but still the best way to make a mybb theme in my opinion.

some benefits to using this are:
* open your theme in its entirety in your text editor of choice
* greppable - easily find what you're looking for
* store your theme in version control

## installation
* prob replace any reference to `iu` with the name of your theme
* replace `REPLACE THIS LOL` with the template set you wanna turn into files/want to use as a starting point
* put it in your plugins folder and activate/install it.

i don't think it requires further explanation, if it does it might be a bit too advanced for you.
